# Wordle

Wordle is a fun puzzle game that really makes you use your brain! The object of the game is to guess a 5-letter word, but you only get 6 chances to guess the word! However, ***there is a catch.*** There is no clue as to what the word is. You have to completely guess at random. 

The reason why I chose this game as my project is that I wanted to pick a game that would be a little bit of a challenge, and maybe even introduce it to people who have never heard of it before!

# Rules to Wordle

[Zack's Wordle](https://ogpanda22.github.io/unit-one-project-wordle/)

As explained earlier, the whole object of Wordle is to guess a 5 letter word, completely chosen at random, in 6 guesses or less. Now you're probably thinking, "How do I know what letters are in the word, and which are not? Are they in the right spot?" Well, hereare the rules to the game to break it down so you can understand!

![Game Example](https://bert.org/assets/posts/wordle/wordle_rules.png)

* Green - The letter is in the word and it is also in the correct spot!

* Yellow - The letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot in the word.

* Gray - The letter is not in the word at all.

# Technologies Used in re-creating Wordle

The technologies used in re-creating my version of Wordle are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

# Next Steps

There are a lot of future plans for this project. From adding transition animations to the letters as the word is being guessed, adding more words to the potential word list, make it to where you don't have to click the key buttons on the screen and you can actually use your keyboard to type the words, changing the color of the keyboard keys to the color of the letters guessed, and much more in depth CSS!
